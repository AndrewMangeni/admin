# Eclipse Setup

It's easy to use Eclipse! Just that this time, you won't be creating new projects. Instead, you'll be **importing projects into existing workspace** since we already created most of the directory structure for you.

1. Fire up Eclipse. It should look like this:

2. In the main menu bar, select `File > Import`. In the window that pops up, select `Existing Projects into Workspace`

3. This window should pop up. Select "Browse"

4. Navigate to the `homework-<youruni>` directory. **This is critical:** Do not add the specific homework (eg. `homework-<youruni>/0`). Instead, add the entire directory `homework-<youruni>`.

5. You should see all the homeworks you have so far being identified as separate projects. If that's correct, click "Finish"

6. Now you can see your homeworks as a projects in Eclipse.
