# Eclipse Setup

It's easy to use Eclipse! Just that this time, you won't be creating new projects. Instead, you'll be **importing projects** since we already created most of the directory structure for you.

1. Fire up Eclipse. It should look like this:

2. Bang `ctrl-n` (Windows) or `cmd-n` (Mac) (if you're on Linux, you know the equivalent).

3. Select `Java Project`

4. This should pop up. Do not enter anything for the Project name or anything else.

5. Uncheck `Use default location` and click on the "Browse" next to the Location bar.

6. A file selection dialog should open. **This is critical:** Go to the folder containing the specific homework. ie. for hw0, go to `homework-<youruni>/0`. **Do not add `homework-<youruni>`** Instead, add the subfolder for your homework. **Do not add the /src only as well. Make sure you add the entire 0 folder**

7. The details should look like this. You may have a different location depending on where you save your homeworks.

8. Now you can see your homework (and just that specific homework) as a project in Eclipse.

You'll need to do this for every homework (as you would any project in Eclipse).
